Welcome to the documentation of the apollon feature extraction framework!
=========================================================================
*apollon* is a feature extraction and modelling frame work for music data
analysis. It handles low-level audio feature extraction, their aggreagation
using Hidden Markov models, and comparison by means of the Self-Organizing Map.
See the :doc:`framework` chapter for gentle introduction to the mentioned
concepts.
